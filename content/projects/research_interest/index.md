## Introduction

In recent years, large-scale pre-trained language models have been rapidly developed and implemented to our society.
The use of artificial intelligence technology, including large-scale pre-trained language models, has always been discussed in the world of journalism.
My research interest is to explore the opportunities and challenges of pre-trained language models in the news media.

## Featured Work

### Pre-Training Language Models

To gain a deeper understanding of pre-trained language models, it is important not only to fine-tune publicly available models, but also to address pre-training.
We build language models using a corpus of Japanese news articles and evaluate the potential for the help of journalism.
We also discuss the healthy use of the model, including time series degradation of the model [1].

### Fine-tuning Language Models

Application of natural language processing techniques for individual tasks in the news media:

- Summarization [2]
- Click-through rate prediction [3]
- Multilingual news similarity scoring [4]
- Reading time estimation [5]
- User age prediction [6]
